       <p> The Christian vocal group Freedom Sound was started in the early 1960s by the late evangelist Dr. Frank Gonzales, my grandfather, although it was originally called the God Squad. He changed the name to Freedom Sound in the early 1970s. The theme of Dr. Gonzales’ ministry was “Win the Lost… at Any Cost” as it continues to be today. Throughout the 1960s, ‘70s, 80’s and until 1994, Dr. Frank Gonzales and Freedom Sound traveled and ministered throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Central America proclaiming the Good News of the Gospel through music in churches, public auditoriums, schools, hospitals, prisons, and even on street corners.</p>
      <p> In 1994, Dr. Gonzales went to his heavenly home, and his oldest daughter Lisa, my mother, and her husband Jay Hernandez, my father, took over the traveling ministry of Freedom Sound. In 1995, Hugo and Sandy Oropeza from Mexico City joined Freedom Sound full-time, and the four of them ministered all over North and Central America until 1999.</p>
<p>At that time, the Lord called Hugo and Sandy Oropeza to start the First Hispanic Church of LaGrange, Georgia as a mission of Rosemont Baptist Church. In early 2000, Jay and Lisa Hernandez were called to California to be music ministers and Co-pastors of Mount of Olives Church. In 2011, they and their children returned to LaGrange, Georgia to re-launch Freedom Sound Ministries along with Pastors Hugo and Sandy Oropeza and their children. Since then, Freedom Sound has returned with a wealth of ministerial experience, new music, and a renewed vision for winning the lost for Christ.</p>
